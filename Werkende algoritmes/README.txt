Project: Finding the path with the lowest amount of insertions to reach Drosophila Miranda from Drosophila Melanogaster. The second goal is to determine the smallest number of
swapped genes taking into account the size of the part of the genome that is reversed. With four algorithms we tried to achieve those goals.
In every file is genome the simplified Drosophila Melanogaster genome and the genomegoal the Drosophila Miranda.

All algorithms are written for Python 2.7. Every algorithm has its own functions and libraries, so no helper files or main files have been used.

The two_ways_0.2.py algorithm does not work yet, because the genome and genomegoal never meet eachother.
